# Homework 1: P-Code Virtual Machine

## Description
This project is a P-Code Virtual Machine.
It utilizes no functions, pointers, or dynamic memory.
Instead, this virtual machine is implemented using a Program Access Space, which holds the Activation Records and also acts as a Stack space.
4 registers act on this space to keep track of the data within, these being the Base pointer, Stack pointer, Program counter, and the Instruction Register

## Compilation Instructions
To compile and run this program, first open a bash terminal and navigate to the directory containing vm.c and the input file.
To compile, "gcc vm.c"

## Usage
[How to run the program, including any required arguments]

Immediately after compiling, use "./a.out input.txt" to run the program. NOTE: the program requires an input text file as an argument to function. NOTE: replace "input.txt" with the name of your .txt file
